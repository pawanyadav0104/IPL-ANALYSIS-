# 🏏 IPL Analysis (2008–2025)

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) from 2008 to 2025. I collected data manually from the **Cricbuzz IPL website** and cleaned it using **Microsoft Excel** before visualizing everything using **Power BI**.

The dashboard includes dynamic visuals like:
- 🏆 **Season Winners & Runner-ups**
- 🔶 **Orange Cap Holders (Top Batters)**
- 🟣 **Purple Cap Holders (Top Bowlers)**
- 📊 **Points Table**
- 🖼️ Visuals with dynamic **images** for caps and team logos

Everything is built around real-world data and visualized using custom DAX measures.
